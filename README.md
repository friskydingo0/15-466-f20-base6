# What's on my mind?

Author: Pavan Paravasthu

Design: This is a 2 player, couples game show in which there are multiple rounds where the players guess what is on the other player's mind when they see a particular image.

Networking: 
PlayMode.cpp implements most of the client functionality including input processing and updating the graphics.
server.cpp has the gameplay logic with ample servings of spaghetti.

How To Play:

The game keeps showing different abstract art images with 3 options. If they both choose the same option, it shows they are compatible. If not, well, incompatible. The player uses the alphanumeric 1, 2 or 3 keys to choose options.
